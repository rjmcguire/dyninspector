Loading is of two types: static and dynamic.

Static loading happens automatically when you run a program. The executable
is loaded into the memory. The shared libraries which are requried are also
loaded, actually mapped, into the address space of the program. All the 
symbols are resolved.

Dynamic loading happens during runtime and is done manually by the user. On
Linux this is done using the 'dlopen', 'dlsym' and 'dlclose' set of functions.
The shared library is mapped into the program memory with 'dlopen'.
Symbols are resolved using 'dlsym' one by one.
The library is removed from the memory using 'dlclose'.
